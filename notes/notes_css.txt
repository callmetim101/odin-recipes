<div></div>
is a basic HTML element that is an empty container and you use other
tags with it; <h1> <p> and etc.

Selectors 
Refer to the HTML elements to which CSS rules apply; they’re what is actually being “selected” for each rule. The following subsections don’t cover every selector available, but they’re by far the most common and the ones you should get comfortable using first.

Universal selector is; *
Every element would have the defined settings

Type Selectors - Also known as element selector
<div>, <p>, and many others

Class Selectors
Select all elements with the given class, which is just an attribute you place on an HTML element.
Example: <div class="alert-text"> This is a test example.</div>
    - This specific class would be referred to as .alert-text {}
    Note the syntax for class selectors: a period immediately followed by the case-sensitive value of the class attribute. Classes aren’t required to be specific to a particular element, so you can use the same class on as many elements as you want.
     - Another thing you can do with the class attribute is to add multiple classes to a single element as a space-separated list, such as class="alert-text severe-alert". Since whitespace is used to separate class names like this, you should never use spaces for multi-worded names and should use a hyphen instead.

ID Selectors
Similar to class selectors. They select an element with the given ID, which is another attribute you place on an HTML element. The major difference between classes and IDs is that an element can only have one ID. It cannot be repeated on a single page and should not contain any whitespace:
Example: <div id="title">My Awesome 90's Page</div>
    - This specific ID would be referred to as #title {}
    For IDs, instead of a period, we use a hashtag immediately followed by the case-sensitive value of the ID attribute. A common pitfall is people overusing the ID attribute when they don’t necessarily need to, and when classes will suffice. While there are cases where using an ID makes sense or is needed, such as taking advantage of specificity or having links redirect to a section on the current page, you should use IDs sparingly (if at all)

Grouping of selectors
To help cut down on repition where settings are the same between multiples
Example:
.alert-text,
.read,
.unread { details here }

.read { unique details here }
.unread { unique details here }

Chaining selectors - Whitespace matters so a space between class selectors indicates a new selector
<div>
  <div class="subsection header">Latest Posts</div>
  <p class="subsection preview">This is where a preview for a post might go.</p>
</div>

CSS would read to only apply to the Latest Posts "subsection header"
.subsection.header {
  color: red;
}
